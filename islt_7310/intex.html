<p>Welcome, my name is Samantha Jett. I have my Associates of Arts from North Central Community College (May 2018) and currently, I am a senior at University of Missouri Online finishing my Bachelors in Education Studies (December 2020). From there I would like to get my Master’s in Sports Management also online. I was raised as a coaches daughter and basketball has been a huge part of my life. I played for many years and in college. I have been a volunteer coach for 5th and 6th grade girls, intern for highschool girls, and student-assistant for a college women’s team. I would like to be a women’s basketball coach as well as an athletic director. My skills include verbal/written communication, time management, analytical skills, and good decision making.</p>
