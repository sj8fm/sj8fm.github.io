     Hello everyone! My name is Samantha Jett but I go by Samm. I’m getting my degree in Education Studies and want to get my masters in Sports Management. I want to be a women’s basketball coach and athletic director. I live in Missouri but I’m in Florida pretty frequently and hoping to move there by August. I took computer technologies last semester and we did a little coding for extra credit but that is the most I have done. It wasn’t too hard but it can be super confusing and frustrating at times! My expectations for this course is to learn a lot I didn’t know I could possibly do which I feel will be useful in my future jobs. I hope in this class I can learn different ways to have information available for my future athletes (like plays) all electronically. I love basketball so I like shooting around and being active. I also love to take my dog to the beach when we are in Florida.
