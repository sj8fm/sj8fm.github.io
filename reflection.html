    <p>My career in basketball starts at a really young age. My dad was a basketball coach since I was born. I attended his district basketball games at only three days old. I went to every game, every practice, and every long trip. Since I was young I knew coaching was what I wanted to do. </p>
    <p>In high school along with playing, I coached our schools 5th and 6th grade girls team. We played every saturday having 3 games. I would arrange practice during the week around my practice for school ball. The girls went undefeated for the 2 years I coached. </p>
    <p>After I graduated high school, I went on to play college ball and still wanted to be involved with coaching. I helped out my trainer with Pure Sweat and trained younger girls. I also was an intern for my high school team during the summer. My last year of playing basketball I decided to be a student assistant for the team and did this for a semester.</p>
